Below Figure (Fig. 1. b. Infer_time_on_B2_for_D1_to_D10.png) presents the complete inference time on the [STM32 Nucleo H7](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html) (B2) for each of the 30 models. 
1. When considering the *FC 1x10* network, for the 4 features Iris dataset (D1), it took 5.16 µs to infer, and for the highest 74 features Human Activity dataset (D10), it took 872.85 µs to infer. 
2. When considering *FC 10x10*, for the Iris dataset, it took 20.15 µs, and 3369.54 µs for the Human Activity dataset.
