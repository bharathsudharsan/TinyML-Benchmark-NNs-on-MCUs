1. When considering the *FC 1x10* network, for the 4 features Iris dataset, it took 5.16 Âµs to infer, and for the highest 74 features Human Activity dataset, it took 872.85 micro sec to infer. 
2. When considering *FC 10x10*, for Iris dataset, it took 20.15 micro sec, and 3369.54 micro sec for Human Activity dataset.
